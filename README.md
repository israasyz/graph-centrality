# Graph Centrality
#### The project aims at applying algorithms based on graph theory to compute the _**centrality**_ property for each node in the graph. It applies three centrality metrics on _**undirected connected graphs**_ which are: _**degree**_, _**closeness**_ and _**betweeness**_ centralities. The project also provides _**visualisation**_ of graphs. The used languages are _**C++**_ and _**Python**_.
## Installation
#### NetworkX that is used by the visualisation tool requires Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7. If you do not already have a Python environment configured on your computer, please see the instructions for installing the full [scientific Python stack](https://scipy.org/install.html). 
#### Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install NetworkX:
```bash
pip install networkx
```
## Optional Packages
#### Some packages like [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) _which provides flexible drawing of graphs_ provides additional functionality.

#### To install _**networkx**_ and all optional packages, do:
```bash
pip install networkx[all]
```
