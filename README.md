# Graph Centrality
###The project aims at applying algorithms based on graph theory to compute the **centrality** property for each node in the graph.
###It applies three centrality metrics on **undirected connected graphs** which are: _**degree**_, _**closeness**_ and _**betweeness**_ centralities.
###The project also provides **visualisation** of graphs.
####The used languages are **C++** and **Python**.
