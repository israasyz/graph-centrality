# Graph Centrality
### The project aims at applying algorithms based on graph theory to compute the **centrality** property for each node in the graph.
It applies three centrality metrics on **undirected connected graphs** which are: _**degree**_, _**closeness**_ and _**betweeness**_ centralities.
The project also provides **visualisation** of graphs.
The used languages are **C++** and **Python**.
