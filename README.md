# Graph Centrality
#### The project aims at applying algorithms based on graph theory to compute the _**centrality**_ property for each node in the graph. It applies three centrality metrics on _**undirected connected graphs**_ which are: _**degree**_, _**closeness**_ and _**betweeness**_ centralities. The project also provides _**visualisation**_ of graphs. The used languages are _**C++**_ and _**Python**_.
